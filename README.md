# USACO-tutorials

This is a repository where I'm going to upload my attempts at the USACO training programme in hope of improving my programming prowess.

The Folders contain the programs. 
x-y, the model of the folder names, is the section exactly that of the USACO section.
Inside each folder will be .java files and .txt files. .java files contain the source-code and the corresponding .txt files contain information on the exercise.

I am aiming to do one exercise everyday. So far (10/9/17) I have done 5 exercises (not including test.java) and I started on 7/9/17.
